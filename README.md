# README

This repo is just a convenient place to for me to save custom workflows for [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/).  Feel free to download anything here that you find useful.

## What's in this repo
Here's an overview of what you will find in this repo (I'll try to keep this current, but no promises):

### SizeUp Workflows
These workflows are basic wrappers around the excellent macOS window manager, [SizeUp](http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/).

Here's an example of how they work:  open Alfred and type a keyword like `right` to move your active window to the right half of the screen.  There are workflows for each of the SizeUp actions that I regularly find myself using.

I find it much easier to use these workflows than to remember SizeUp's shortcut keys.  All my SizeUp workflow keywords are simple and describe the action I want to take on the active window (ex. `center`, `left`, `right`, `fullscreen`, etc.).
